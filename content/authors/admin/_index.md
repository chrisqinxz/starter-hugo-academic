I'm a researcher in the area of wireless communication and signal processing.
My research focuses on how to use Bayesian theory to improve the capability of
signal detection and estimation process that will determine the KPI of wireless
communication. Recently, I made efforts in the exploration of Bayesian-driven
deep learning methodologies to standardize the 5G's architecture from baseband
receiver design to radio digital pre-distortion (DPD). I'm also self-motivated
to pioneer the potential technologies that will contribute to 6G.
